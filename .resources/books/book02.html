<p><font size='25'>Sauce Preparation</font></p>
<p>The trick to a good consistent result is a warm salty sauce with a good distribution of common properties. We even out sauces of their natural variations caused by aspects such as race, diet, and fitness.</p>
<p>What You'll Need:</p>
<ul>
	<li>3 Servings of your favourite baby gravy.</li>
	<li>A cooking pot.</li>
</ul>
<p>What You'll Get:</p>
<ul>
	<li>2 servings of fresh plain nut honey.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven't already you're going to need to get some brogurt. The best sauces are always made out of free range locally sourced man cream. It's really easy to find, almost anyone you run into will be willing to give a hand supplying you with fresh jerk rub.</p>
<p>Pour your 3 helpings of junkmilk into the cooking pot. Allow to simmer for 5 minutes on low heat. Stir slowly the entire time. This process will remove impurities and even out the properties giving us a good solid base to use in other dude food. We will lose a little volume from this process but worth it for the end result.</p>
